# Competitive_Programming

These are all my solutions to problems from various competitions, the majority from USACO contests and training pages. I have been competing since freshman year. All of the solutions in this repository pass their intended problem requirements but may not be the most optimal because I'm learning as I go. Hope these help you out and good luck!
