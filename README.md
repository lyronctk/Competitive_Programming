# Competitive Programming

These are all my solutions to problems from various competitions- with the majority being from **USACO** contests and training pages. They employ a wide range of **techniques, data structures, and algorithms** implemented in **C++** such as **Dynamic Programming, Suffix Tries, Segment Trees, Dijkstra's, Fulkerson Maximum Flow, etc**. I have been competing since freshman year but just recently pushed to github. All of the solutions in this repository pass their intended problem requirements but may not be the most optimal because I'm also learning as I go. Hope these help you out and **good luck**!
