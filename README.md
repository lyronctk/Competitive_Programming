# Competitive_Programming

These are all my solutions to problems from various competitions, the majority from USACO contests and training pages. They employ a wide range of techniques, data structures, algorithms such as Dynamic Programming, Prefix Tries, Dijkstra's, and Kruskal's. I have been competing since freshman year but just recently pushed to github. All of the solutions in this repository pass their intended problem requirements but may not be the most optimal because I'm learning as I go. Hope these help you out and good luck!
